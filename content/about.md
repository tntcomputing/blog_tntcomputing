Hello my name is Andy Tyrrell. I am, in no particular order, a computer programmer, shop owner, qualified ICT teacher, Dad, electronics enthusiast, radio amateur and amatuer old school film photographer. 

I have made the decision to transition into an IT role. This blog is documenting my studies as I work towards the Cisco CCNA and Microsoft's Azure certifications
