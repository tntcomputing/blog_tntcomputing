          &lt;p&gt;30 days to learn a new skill with a 50% voucher off a microsoft exam for completing the &lt;a href = &#34;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/30-days-to-learn-it&#34;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the Azure Solutions Architext challenge. The course is approximatly 30 hours long, spread over 35 modules. For the most part you don&#39;t need an Azure subscription as Microsoft provides sandboxes for the labs. There were a few modules that did require a subscription, helpfully they reminded you to clear up the resourse groups afterwards so you don&#39;t end up with a large bill at the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hands on nature of the course was great for building confidence in using the portal and the command line interface. After a while the workflow becomes familiar and your progress speeds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is the 50% off voucher is a one time deal, well Microsoft say you can apply for another in 6 months but the offer will be finished by then.&lt;/p&gt;
